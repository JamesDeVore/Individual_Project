This note will explain the database structure, and the types of data I will need to make the app
run effectively.

There are two main flavors of data, Users and Sensor data.

I think Users will have the following data (columns in a database??):
username, name, email, password HASH, imgUrl, dog breed (size), age, idNumber, friendIDs, goals?

DATA will have the following data points:
Lat (N/S), LNG (E/W), timestamp, altitude, speed, date, userID (to associate the datapoints with the user)
